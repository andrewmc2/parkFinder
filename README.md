parkFinder
==========

This is a program I built using the Google Maps API and the Toronto Open Data site. It helps you find parks in Toronto and filter by type. It also dynamically generates Instagram pics from the park based on Instagram tags! The site is responsive and I used the Foundation framework. Check it out live at http://www.andrewmc2.com/park
